# features are some attributes of a object (think as OOPS model) and label are tag on the basis of features of the object.
# and features goes as input in ML Algorithm and spead-out output as label
# ML Algorithm basically does some calculation on some features and find some rules to identify a label
#so, ML algorithm's work is on the basis of some features create some rules to find a specific label
